End Semester Project for Advance Programming

## PROGRAM 1: ## 
Write a program that automatically converts English text to Morse code and vice versa.


# PROGRAM 2: ##
Given two strings, write a program that efficiently finds the longest common subsequence.

## PROGRAM 3: ##
Given two strings, write a program that outputs the shortest sequence of character insertions and deletions that turn one string into the other.

## PROGRAM 4: ##
Write a function that multiplies two matrices together. Make it as efficient as you can and compare the performance to a polished linear algebra library for your language. You might want to read about Strassen’s algorithm and the effects CPU caches have. Try out different matrix layouts and see what happens.


## PROGRAM 5: ##
 Write a program that plays BattleShip against human opponents. It takes coordinates as input and outputs whether that was a hit or not and its own shot’s coordinates.
